✅ What is Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
Simple RAG is a two-step process where an AI system:

Retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base (e.g., using vector similarity search).

Generates an answer using a language model (like OpenAI or HuggingFace models), grounded in the retrieved documents.

📦 Use Cases of Simple RAG:
Use Case	Description
Customer Support Bot	Answers user queries using internal docs or FAQs.
Medical FAQ Assistant	Pulls from trusted sources to answer health questions.
Internal Search Bot	Employees ask questions about company policy or documentation.
Product Assistant	Users get help with product setup or troubleshooting.

🛠️ Example: Build a Simple RAG app using:
LangChain (for chaining retrieval + generation)

HuggingFace Embeddings

FAISS (for vector storage and retrieval)

Streamlit (for UI)
